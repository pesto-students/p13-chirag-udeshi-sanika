    <!--First stanza-->
    <p>
      I'm Nobody! Who are you? <br />Are you - Nobody - Too? <br />
      Then there's a pair of us!
    </p>
    <!--Second stanza-->
    <p>
      Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know! <br />How dreary - to be -
      Somebody!<br />
      How public - like a Frog -<br />
      To tell one's name - the livelong June - To an admiring Bog!
